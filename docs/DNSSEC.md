#  DNS Request with DNSSEC & Response Validation (Using 8.8.8.8)

##  What is DNSSEC?

**DNSSEC** (Domain Name System Security Extensions) adds **security** to DNS by verifying that DNS responses havenâ€™t been **tampered with**. It does this using **digital signatures** attached to DNS records.

##  How `measuredns` Supports DNSSEC

When you run a DNS query using `measuredns`, you can **enable DNSSEC** by setting the `DO` (**DNSSEC OK**) bit in the query. This tells the DNS server to include **DNSSEC-related records** (like `DNSKEY` and `RRSIG`) in the response.

In our tool, this is done using the `DNSQuery` class with `want_dnssec=True`.

We use **Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8)** which supports DNSSEC.

##  How to Send a DNSSEC-enabled Query

```python
result = send_dns_query(
    DNSQuery(qname="cloudflare.com", rdtype="A", want_dnssec=True),
    "8.8.8.8"
)

```
